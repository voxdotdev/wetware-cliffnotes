## The Dreyfus Model 

### Stage 1: Novices 

Novices have little to no previous experience and are very concerned about their ability to succeed. With little experience to guide them they really don't kow whether their actions will all turn out OK. 

Novices don't particularly want to learn, they just want to accomplish an immediate goal. They do not know how to respond to mistakes and so are fairly vulnerable to confusion when things go awry.

They can be effective when given context-free rules to follow, rules that follow "Whenever X happens, do Y." In other words, they need a recipe. 

This is why call centers work. You can hire a large number of folks who don't have a lot of experience in the subject matter at hand and let them navigate a decision tree.  


### Stage 2: Advanced Beginners


### Stage 3: Competent

### Stage 4: Proficient 

### Stage 5: Expert

Next Actions

✷ Rate yourself. Where do you see yourself in the Dreyfus model for the primary skills you use at work? List the ways your current skill level impacts you. 

✷ Identify other skills where you are a novice, advanced beginner, and so on. Be aware of the possibility of second-order incompetence when making these evaluations. 

✷ For each of these skills, decide what you need to advance to the next level. Keep these examples in mind as you read the remainder of this book. 

✷ Think back to problems you’ve experienced on a project team. Could any of them have been avoided if the team had been aware of the Dreyfus model? What can you do differently going forward? 

✷ Think of your teammates: Where are they on their journey? How can that be helpful to you?
