### Why does this exist 

I'm forcing myself to do write ups of the books I read related to programming / logical thinking, as I have a penchant to collecting books but not actually reading them. This serves to slow me down and hopefully better retain the suggestions / advice these resources provide. 

Additionally, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation, but I like to believe the more I learn about programming and development, the more my grammar and articulateness declines. Whether this is true or a lie I tell myself to feel better, I hope these write-ups will help correct that.
