## **SMART Goals**
Smart goals is a method of planning, an outline to help make large goals and ideas into actionable, achievable items.


### **Specific** 

First, an objective should be specific. That is, it’s not enough to say “I want to learn X.” Narrow that down to something concrete, "I want to learn X so I can Y." 

Personal Example: I want to learn Python. 

Specified: 
“I want to be able to write a script in Python that automates file backups”

### **Measurable** 

How do you know when you’re done? That has always been one of my favorite consulting questions. To have any chance of meeting an objective, you have to be able to measure it somehow. Measurable goes hand-in-hand with being specific.

If you think you can’t measure your objective, then it’s probably not specific enough.

You don’t have to see where you’re going; you don’t have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the away. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you.

### **Achievable** 

A goal or objective that you cannot attain is not a target; it’s just a maddening, soul-sucking frustration. Some things are just not possible for most people—competing at an Olympic level, for instance. Others are possible, but at a disproportionate commitment of time and resources (say, running in a marathon).

So, be reasonable about it. You might be able to write “Hello, World!” or a simple application in a new language by next week, but you’re probably not going to be able to write a complete web application framework and user interface builder with a neural net optimizer. Make each next objective attainable from where you are now.

### **Relevant** 

Does this really matter to you—is it important to you, and are you passionate about it? Is it something that’s even under your control?

It needs to matter and be something that you have control over.


### **Time-Boxed**

Without deadlines, a goal will languish and be perpetually pushed aside by the more pressing exigencies of the day. It will never happen. Again, take small bites. Give yourself frequent, small milestones. You’ll be more motivated when you meet them and encouraged to rise to meet the next one.


### How to get started 

Sometimes a goal can be so overwhelming it's difficult to find a starting point, a thread to pick at to start to unravel the tangle. 

Break it down. It's probably been repeated ad-nauseam but this is the way. 

Create 5 or 10 minute tasks, just to get started. 

If you don't know enough about your topic, for example, how to start learning about it, seek out others. Find peers who already know what you're trying to learn, or look up resources online. Chances are someone has been where you are now and will have guidance.

“Setting yourself a goal is the first step. The next step in an action plan is to create small objectives that allow you to achieve something every day or so. The more small objectives you have, the more easily you’ll see where you are in relation to your goal.”
—Johanna Rothman

### ACTION ITEM: 

Make a list of 3 of your most important goals. Make sure each objective follows the SMART characteristics.
